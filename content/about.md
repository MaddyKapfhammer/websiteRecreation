The question game was a favorite of mine; I often annoyed my father with consistent questions about how light bulbs worked and what makes bones break, and then my usual response of "why" after his responses. Thankfully, after a while, my elementary school teachers took over in that role, and I thrived in a distinct learning environment, where my questions were always met with at least some type of answer. My questions continued to grow in quantity and depth, only contributing further to my qualities as a student. Iny my younger years I was fascinated with King Tut--perhaps even obsessed--to a point where I spent all of my time reading the same book about ancient Egypt. In high school my interests shifted ever so significantly to Physics, English and Biology. I focused on centripetal force, Shakespeare's Macbeth, and the virus life cycle. My teachers can attest that I have always been an engaged and dynamic student who does not just learn to get A's on exams, but rather learns because she just loves learning. My love for Biology, and now Computer Science has only been compounded at Allegheny College, where each day I am both challenged and fulfilled by learning new ideas, concepts and often having hard discussions with my professors, peers and colleagues. |
