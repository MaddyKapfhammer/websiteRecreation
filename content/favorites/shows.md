While being a college student is a full time job, I have found that watching television is _absolutely_ my guilty pleasure. There is nothing I like more (perhaps other than talking to friends, or eating a home cooked meal) than sitting down on the couch, and turning on a great show. Now, I am going to be honest, I probably spend much more time than I should binging my favorite shows, but I think that just makes me even more qualified to give you some new show suggestions.

Let it be known, that I, Madelyn Kapfhammer **do not** own a real television. I know, I know, it's crazy, but your laptop (or even phone) can work just as well! With that being said, Hulu and Netflix are really my go-to's when it comes to finding entertainment, and my interests vary significantly from reality TV to crime documentaries. Here are a few of my favorites as of recently:
