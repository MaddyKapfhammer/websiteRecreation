# You Can Call Me Maddy

Hello! It's great to meet you! My name is Madelyn Kapfhammer, but _please_ call me Maddy (all of my friends do). I am a senior at [Allegheny College](https://allegheny.edu/) double majoring in **biology** and **computer science** and minoring in **global health studies**. Yes, it is an interesting and difficult combination, but I have a unique passion for all of these fields and am so excited to continue my journey into the fields of **bioinformatics** and **data analytics**. Along with being a student, I am a daughter, Constant Comment tea _lover_, _avid_ Spotify user, sincere friend, and foodie _extraordinaire_! At Allegheny, I am a technical leader, and a software engineer for the computer science department, public health informatics lab manager, biology teaching assistant, engaged student, and big fan of the classic brick streets.

With my combination of biology and computer science, I am excited to pursue a future in computational epidemiology. I have a **dramatic curiosity** for disease systems modeling, software development and predictive analytics. I hope to find a unique combination of all of these interests in a graduate school program, leading me down a path to work for national health agencies. I often spend my time studying, but when you can't find me sitting at a table on the second floor of the campus center at Allegheny at my laptop, I'm usually spending time with my family, working at a local coffee shop or hanging with my friends and dog Bosco.
